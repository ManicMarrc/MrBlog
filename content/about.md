## Who is ManicMarrc?

That would be me! My name is Marrc and I go by ManicMarrc on the web. I'm a hobby programmer which means that I write code for the fun! (even if that fun is only like 1% of the programming experience).   
I come from a place where we do not speak English as our primary language. If you find a grammatical error in any of the posts, please report it to me!   
I usually use low-level programming languages like C, C++, and Rust (it makes me feel cool üòé) and I primarily write games with them. Although, I'm not scared to try other things.

## What is this website?

This website is a blog made by me to force myself to learn more about the English language, while also doing the thing I love most üòç. This website also let me keep track of my progress as both an English learner and as a programmer.   

## Who is this website for?

This website is primarily for the folks who has a niche problem and no solution on the internet. This website also contains my opinions on some topic about programming (first-impressions and stuffs like that).   
This website is also for me, ManicMarrc. If in the future I have a problem I already solved but I forgot how, I can just look at this blog!
